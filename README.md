This Python code show a rotating shaded cube in the terminal. It defines the cube's vertices, edges, and faces, using functions to rotate, project, and draw the vertices on a 2D plane, calculating shading based on light intensity. The main loop rotates the cube, updates the screen every 0.05 seconds.
